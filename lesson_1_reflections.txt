What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

    Weil mehrere Dateien einen logischen Codeblock bilden

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff commitid1 commitid2
    git log
    git log --stat

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Man kann jederzeit zum funktionierenden Code zurückkehren
